location: McKaw Theater, Chicago
synopsis: Drawing on her experience as a reporter, and her stint writing for a regional newspaper in D.C., director Angeli Primlani places the Scottish Play into the anxious period of the first Bush Administration. The play is about ambition, and the lengths one man will go to justify himself. Fight designer H. Russ Brown brings his gleeful passion for mayhem to the fight choreography. Jeff-award winning costume designer Kate Setzer Kamphausen puts the cast into the particular dress code of the Bush-era political culture. Local Indie-Rock band Buckman Page contributes their lyric, hopeful music to the show.
