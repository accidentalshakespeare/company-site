Join us for a rare treat: a Tennessee Williams farce! Accidental Sheakespeare
presents this all-female piece for the first time in Chicago in over a decade.

A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur is a late-period one-act play about four
single womens' struggles with loneliness and issues of class during the height
of the Great Depression in St. Louis, Missouri.
